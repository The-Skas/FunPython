# Excercise:
# ----------

This is an excercise where students have to fix the code in the file "turtle_if.py"
At the moment, the turtle movement is bugged! 
Change the if else statement to make the turtle movement possible with ALL arrow keys.

# Goal: Make a turtle move around the screen with your keyboard! -->

Make sure both files, turtle_if.py and turtle_setup.py , are in the same folder.
Then run turtle_if.py
